# Master-s-Thesis---Developing-Brain-Maching-Interfaces

The code in this repository is used for my master's thesis project - Developing Brain-Machine Interfaces

The two folders hold all the functions used for obtaining the results.

The first one - Cambridge Neuroscience Lab Functions holds all functions borrowed from the Krupic Lab for processing neural data and spike sorting

The second one - My Functions, contains all functions written by me and used in the project. Two main functions - decoding_f_v2 and decoding_unsorted_v2 are the main ones for spike-sorted and raw data position decoding respectively. Most of the other functions not used by these main ones are used for plotting and data visualisation throughout my project
