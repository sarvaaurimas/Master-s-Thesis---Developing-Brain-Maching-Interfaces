%DECODE_CALCBAYESPOST Bayes decoding of pos given spikes & history
% Decodes spatial location based on several factors: i) spikes in observed
% time window (and knowledge of historic spikes), ii) p(x), historic
% probability of being at location x, iii) decoded location in time steps
% preceeding the current one. 
%
% Re. the latter factor. In other words we assume the animal is unlikely 
% to move far from the the last decoded loction. Since the code does not 
% have access to groudn truth location this does introduce the  possibility 
% of it sticking with an erroneous decode. Note also this closeness prior 
% is applied as a 2D gaussian centred on the previous decode location with 
% a sigma proportionate to the mean running speed in the last 15 time
% windows.

% Other than that code is similar to the naive ML decoder
% decode_calcPost which: for each time step activity in population of
% cells is compared with ratemaps and a posterior probability of the animal
% being in different locations is calculated assuming possion dynamics.
% Note because we must have access to the previously decoded location the
% code is sequential and hence slow
%
%
% Calculation of the posterior  is based on that which
% we used in Towse (2014) which is based on Mathis (2012) eq 3.1 page9.
% Full Bayes approarch is adapted from Zhang et al 1998. (J NeuroPhys)
% specfically page 1024 onwards. See eq 36 for version without history and
% note that compared to the standard ML method division by factorial is not
% applied.
